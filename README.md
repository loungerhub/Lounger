# LOUNGER — Brand Documentation

> **Men’s outerwear brand from Saint Petersburg, Russia.**  
> Lounger is not clothing. It is a *vibe* created by men who build themselves, their families, and their space.

---

## 🧭 Brand Essence

**Core Statement:**  
> Lounger is a brotherhood of creators.  
> The brand crafts garments for men who create — themselves, their family, their space, and their future.

**Philosophy:**  
Lounger rejects loud clichés of “modernity,” “style,” and “quality.”  
Instead, it speaks the language of calm mastery, dignity, and self-discipline.

**Competitors:**  
Not other brands — but mediocrity, consumerism, fear, and dependency.

**Unique Value Proposition (USP):**  
> *The right to be called a Lounger.*
