# 👋 Hi, I'm Tatiana — founder of **LOUNGER**

A microbrand project in the making — designing **functional menswear** that feels like an extension of your environment, not decoration.

> **"Right to be called a Lounger."**

## 🧥 About LOUNGER

Minimalist. Technical. Quiet. Our brand is inspired by urban resilience, modular design, and neutral expression.

We believe:
- 🏙 Clothes should *adapt* to the city, not compete with it.
- ⚙️ Functionality = style. Not the other way around.
- 🌱 A wardrobe should be **light**, **durable**, and **reusable** across contexts.

## 📦 Project Goals
- Build a public knowledge base of design principles, materials, product ideas, and visual culture.
- Collaborate with local or remote creatives (product designers, 3D modelers, textile nerds, photographers).
- Grow a **semantic graph** of concepts to support future AI-powered fashion workflows.

## 📂 Key Repos
- [`urban-shell`](https://github.com/yourusername/urban-shell) — concept, visual moodboards, product descriptions, materials.
- *(More coming soon: design system, interactive lookbook, garment logic in JSON)*

## 🧠 Long-term Vision
Creating a platform-independent, headless-first **microbrand engine** where each product has:
- 📄 A JSON schema
- 🧩 Modular assets
- 🎯 Market context
- 💬 LLM-readable narrative

And where anyone who connects with our values can fork, remix, and reimagine the brand.
